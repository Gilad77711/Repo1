This repo contains my course project to Coursera "Getting And Cleaning Data" course.
run_analysis.R t contains all functions and code,
the code does this:

1. downloade the files and unzip it  in R, assigning them to objects- "X_train","y_train" and ect.
2. assigning the names of the features to an object named "f".
3. Cleaning the data.
4. Merging the files into one big data set calles "my_data".
