# My work
note: The detailed steps are in the r file.
First, i downloaded and unzipped the files in R, and assigned them to objects- "X_train","y_train" and ect.
I also assigned the names of the features to an object named "f".
Then i merged the data into an object i called "my_data" and merged the features names into it.
Then i created a different data set called "mean_and_sd" containing only the mead and sd variables from "my_data" with "subject_id" and "activity_id".
At step 3 i renamed the activity factors in "mean_and_sd" according to the activity names from the web site.
Finally, i callculated the mean for each activity of each variable, then the mean for each subject of each variable, merged them together and exported it to csv file.
#Variable names:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
